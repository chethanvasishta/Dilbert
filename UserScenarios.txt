Big Picture Thoughts

1. There needs to be a centralized server running that's like a virtual manager. It should be ideally a person.
2. It needs to learn the personalities of people who are using it. This will be useful to know their availability in office for various things like scheduling meetings, preferred meeting rooms, frequently contacted people, projects working on (for better speech recognition) etc.
